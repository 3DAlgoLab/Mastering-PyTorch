**Build powerful neural network architectures using advanced PyTorch 1.x features**

## What is this book about?
Deep learning is driving the AI revolution, and PyTorch is making it easier than ever before for anyone to build deep learning applications. This PyTorch book will help you uncover expert techniques to get the most out of your data and build complex neural network models.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Implement text and music generating models using PyTorch
* Build a deep Q-network (DQN) model in PyTorch
* Export universal PyTorch models using Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)
* Become well-versed with rapid prototyping using PyTorch with fast.ai
* Perform neural architecture search effectively using AutoML

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
if (test expression)
{
  Statement upon condition is true
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for data scientists, machine learning researchers, and deep learning practitioners looking to implement advanced deep learning paradigms using PyTorch 1.x. Working knowledge of deep learning with Python programming is required.
